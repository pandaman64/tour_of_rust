# Tour of Rust

Welcome to the source repo of [Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/).

# Goals

This project is meant to give an experienced programmer a swift introduction to Rust as an alternative to reading lengthy book style documentation.

* Chapter 1 - The Basics
* Chapter 2 - Basic Control Flow
* Chapter 3 - Basic Data Structure Types
* Chapter 4 - Generic Types
* Chapter 5 - Ownership & Borrowing Data
* Chapter 6 - Text
* Chapter 7 - Object Oriented Programming
* Chapter 8 - Smart Pointers
* Chapter 9 - Project Organization and Structure

Content goals:
* Chapter 1-4 should give you a strong taste of Rust's aesthetic
* Chapter 1-6 should give a a person from C a good idea how their ideas translate
* Chapter 1-8 should give a a person from C++ a good idea how their ideas translate
* Chapter 9+ should talk about Rust specific concepts that doesn't fit well into the above

This project also aims to provide this book in as many languages as possible.

# Looking for translators!

If you would like to contribute translations in a language that doesn't exist yet.  Feel free to make an issue and I will modify the generator for your language.

The only file you should modify in your pull request is: **lessons.yaml**

Adding new languages should be as simple as adding new properites per page under an appropriate language code object. Let's assume we're doing spanish and your language code is "es":

* **title** - this would be your localized page's title
* **content_markdown** - this would be your localized page's content as markdown using [shodown markdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown's-Markdown-syntax)
* **code** (optional) - this would be your localized page's code. This is the "embedded link" generated from https://play.rust-lang.org/ when you hit the "Share" button. Be sure your run the "rustfmt" tool! If you don't provide code, a page will fallback onto an english version of code (if it exists).

```yaml
  - es:
      title: Capítulo 3 - Conclusión
      content_markdown: |
        ¡Rust tiene algunos increíbles ** punteros **!

        * A
        * `let`
        * C
      code: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&code=fn%20main()%20%7B%7D%0A

```


Lastly, there is a section for common words you should fill out your localized translations of for deeper experience of the site.
